# Tic-Tac-Nine

Tic-Tac-Nine is a version of Tic-Tac-Toe where nine 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board games make up a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board. The objective is to win three Tic-Tac-Toe games so that you win a game on the Tic-Tac-Nine board. 

The game starts with the option of playing a tournament mode or two player mode. 

<b> Tournament Mode </b> <br>
Tournament mode allows you to have two players play a best out of __ games. The number of games is an option that the players can input. Each individual game is played the same as the two player mode (seen below).

<b> Two Player Mode </b> <br>
Players will put in two names. The first person will be "O"s and the second person will be "X"s. The "X" player will begin the first game and every subsequent individual Tic-Tac-Toe game (trying to fix this so the person who starts each subsequent game is the winner of the previous).  If there is a tie, the individual who did not go first will win by default. To win the entire Tic-Tac-Nine game, a player has to win three games that create a winning Tic-Tac-Toe board on the Tic-Tac-Nine board. Every time someone wins a game, the square on the Tic-Tac-Nine board will change to the winner's shape.
